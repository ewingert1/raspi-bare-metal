41 registres :

GPFSELn, avec n dans {0..5} :
Each pin can have an attributed function, such a input, output or special functions.
The following 3-bits combinations set the behaviour of the selected pin.
(Extracted from BCM2835 datasheet)
000 = GPIO Pin is an input 
001 = GPIO Pin is an output 
100 = GPIO Pin takes alternate function 0 
101 = GPIO Pin takes alternate function 1 
110 = GPIO Pin takes alternate function 2 
111 = GPIO Pin takes alternate function 3 
011 = GPIO Pin takes alternate function 4 
010 = GPIO Pin takes alternate function 

Then we can see that a normal 32bits register can select a function for 10 GPIO pins
bits : 	2 - 0 for the GPIO_0 pin
and so on: 
		29 - 27 for the GPIO_9 pin


So, in order to set pin GPIO_n, we'll have to find the right register 
using an integer division by 10,
then take the rest of the division as an offset to navigate in the double word.
